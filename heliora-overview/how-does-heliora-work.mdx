# Liquidity Providers

*Optimize Your Returns*

Liquidity providers (LP) only need to register their wallet with Heliora by signing a message to accept the terms and conditions. After which, LPs continue their normal activities with partner protocols and earn more via **Boosted Deals**, or deposit into **Heliora Vaults** to gain exposure to unique rewards.

# Protocols

*Efficiently Attract Liquidity*

Heliora's team focuses deeply on understanding our network of 300K+ LPs, with specific focus on larger scale depositors. With these relationships, the team advises effective strategies for liquidity deployment, ensuring the offering by our protocols attracts liquidity without spending excess emissions.

Manage these deals through the **Client Portal** where you can track the development of your Heliora Member liquidity and earnings.

# Distribution Partners

*Monetize and Earn Revenue*

Leverage your distribution to generate consistent revenue streams while farming ownership and upside in Heliora's distribution protocol.

Signup to our **Client Portal** to integrate Heliora Earn into your website or community. Direct users to a simple Heliora-hosted link or integrate the Earn SDK to more deeply embed deposit access into your frontend.
