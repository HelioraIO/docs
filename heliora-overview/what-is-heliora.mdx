Heliora is the first **Distribution Protocol** that monetizes the Web3 activity by tracking user wallet activity for:

• liquidity they deploy and the yield they earn

• swaps they make and route through protocol partners

• the stake they delegate to our validators

• referral code they use

Heliora monetizes any activity that makes economic sense by leveraging APIs, allowing distribution partners to generate additional income without exposing users to any additional risks, actions or steps. Heliora members benefit through:

• **Exclusive Deals**: Access to exclusive, backroom liquidity deals to boost yields.

• **Sustainable Growth**: Contribute to and benefit from the growth of partner protocols.

• **Aligned Incentives**: Operate within a framework that realigns incentives among key Web3 stakeholders, including developers, LPs, venture capitalists, and auditors.

• **Collective Due Diligence**: Opportunities pushed via Heliora undergo a robust diligence process, providing Heliora members with peace of mind as they deploy into Heliora's dealflow.

• **Self-Custody**: Your funds remain entirely under your control.

• **Inclusive Access**: Open to everyone, not just institutions or accredited investors.

Heliora aims to align the incentives amongst key DeFi players, Liquidity Providers (LPs), Developers, Venture Capitalists, Security Auditors, and Miners.

The core mission of Heliora is to offer a safeguarding layer in DeFi, ensuring that liquidity is deployed with transparency and due diligence, promoting superior risk-adjusted returns for all stakeholders while mitigating protocol and downside risks.

Since our MVP launch in March 2024, Heliora has grown into Web3's largest distribution protocol, with over 275,000+ wallets registered to boost their Web3 rewards. Membership is as simple as signing a single message!
