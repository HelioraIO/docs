• Never acts as a counterparty in any LP transaction within Web3. You deposit in the protocols themselves

• Never controls or handles members' liquidity, ensuring utmost security and autonomy.

The absence of smart contracts offers several advantages for Heliora:

• Maintaining agility and adaptability, seamlessly integrating with various protocols without added complexity.

• Minimizing technical debt and counterparty risk by eliminating an additional smart contract layer.

• Reducing gas fees for depositing and withdrawing funds from partner protocols.

• Mitigating regulatory risks associated because Heliora does not hold your funds.
