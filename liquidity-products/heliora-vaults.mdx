Heliora Vaults allow LPs to passively earn risk-mitigated rewards without manually rotating between opportunities. These vaults serve as the foundation for larger ecosystem campaigns, enabling protocols to plug into a unified liquidity layer.

Vaults are built in collaboration with partners across vault architecture, curation, rewards tracking, and protocol integrations. LPs can manage positions, claims, and new opportunities directly via the Heliora webapp.

This offering marks a step toward a more integrated experience and introduces new efficiencies in capital allocation throughout the Heliora ecosystem.
