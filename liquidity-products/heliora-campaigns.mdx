Heliora's **Campaigns** product (or Ecosystem-as-a-Service) powers large-scale liquidity campaigns for protocols seeking to bootstrap DeFi activity.

By coordinating across vaults, rewards, and protocol partners, Heliora marries capital and incentives to drive healthy ecosystem growth. Campaigns are tailored to attract the right type of liquidity for each ecosystem's goals.

The flagship TAC Summoning Campaign attracted over $650M in its first monthâ€”demonstrating strong signs of product-market fit and the potential of this coordinated approach.
